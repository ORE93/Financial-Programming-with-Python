You work for a lending startup engaged in microcredit loans. The company needs help valuing these loans. In this Challenge, you'll automate a process that does just that.

## What You're Creating
Youâ€™ll create a Python program that automates the tasks associated with valuing microlending loans. Specifically, you'll do the following:

- Create a GitHub Repository

- Automate the Calculations

- Analyze Loan Data

- Perform Financial Calculations

- Conditionally Filter Lists of Loans

- Save the Results

You'll then upload your final code to GitHub.
